# Underscores

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `Underscores` or `_s`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.


## Getting Started

If you want to set things up manually, download `Underscores` from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the `Underscores` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, Webovation).

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme.

Good luck!
