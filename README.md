# Underscores

Hi. I'm a starter theme called Underscores or _s, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.


## Getting Started

If you want to set things up manually, download `underscores` from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the _s directory and change the name to something else (like, say, megatherium), and then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.
